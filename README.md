# Mangarr
Mangarr is an *arr (sonarr, radarr) inspired approach to downloading manga. In contrast to the arr suite it does not do this by making use of newsgroups and torrents, but instead it uses a collection of sources.

# Getting Started

## Installation

Mangarr's "intended" use is using docker containers. My suggestion would be to have a look at the docker-compose.yml file in this repository for an example of how to set it up.

# Support

Mangarr is in a **very** early stage of development and therefore you will most likely run into broken things, or missing features.

Please report any issues that you run into, and also feel free to suggest new features, or request new sources.
